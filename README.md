# PremiumArr

Currently it supports basically all of the Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr, ... but only in form of a blackhole folder.
In the future I will add support for the API of Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, ... so it can mark downloads as failed (-> next release).

The state is preserved in a SQLite DB - so even if the container is restarted / crashed / updated the state is preserved.

Works around some limitations of the Premiumize Cloud Downloader, like the 'you already have this file uploaded' error.

It's still under heavy development, so expect bugs and missing features.


## Docker Image

The Docker Image is available on Docker Hub: [premiumarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/horotw/premiumarr)

## Docker run

To run the docker image after building it, run the following command:
```bash
docker run -e API_KEY=your_API_key \
           -e RECHECK_PREMIUMIZE_CLOUD_DELAY=120\
           -v /path/to/blackhole:/blackhole \
           -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
           -v /path/to/done:/done \
           -v /path/to/config:/config \
           premiumarr:latest
```

## Example for Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  premiumarr:
    image: horotw/premiumarr:latest
    container_name: premiumarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - API_KEY=your_API_key
      - RECHECK_PREMIUMIZE_CLOUD_DELAY=120
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin
    volumes:
      - /path/to/blackhole:/blackhole # The same as the blackhole folder you use in e.g. sonarr
      - /path/to/downloads:/downloads # Temporary download folder for the files while downloading
      - /path/to/done:/done # The folder where the files are moved to after downloading (e.g. the same as the one in sonarr)
      - /path/to/config:/config # The config folder for the app to persist the state
```

## Web View

A web view is available to show the current state of the database. It displays all entries with a working state and some of the entries with 'done' or 'failed' state, with pagination support for more entries.
It's available at PORT 5000.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for improvements or bug fixes.

## Improvements to come
- [ ] Add support for Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, ... API to mark downloads as failed
  - [ ] Maybe fake the NZBGet API to be easy integrated in Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, ...
- [ ] Remove Lists and use solely the DB (where it fits)
- [ ] Refactor the code to have functions for state transitions (-> back to found state if fail in ... state)
- [ ] Think about a state machine for the Downloads so the next step per download is clear (and fallbacks in state are easy to implement)
- [ ] Add a way to pause downloads
- [ ] Add a Scheduler to download files at a specific time
- [ ] Dedicated thread for Downloading

## Latest Changes
- [X] Add a WebUI to see the status
- [X] Add real logging (with levels) (currently only print statements)
- [X] Monitor how long a DL is 'Moving to cloud' and retry if it takes too long (more than 15min)
- [X] Find downloads that are 'somehow lost' e.g. the user removed them before they got downloaded it from the cloud downloader and again upload them do the web downloader

## Why a state machine?
What does every state have?
 - Expected current state (e.g. 'Uploading')
 - Actual current state (with checker functions)
 - Expected next state (e.g. 'Moving to cloud')
 - Expected fallback state (e.g. 'Uploading' if 'Moving to cloud' fails)
